## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm Beatriz Tavernaro, a passionate **Full Stack Developer** from Brazil with a strong focus on building scalable, efficient, and well-structured backend systems using **C# and .NET**.

I love designing APIs and backend architectures that are clean, maintainable, and built to last. Recently, I've been exploring the world of **AI**, building intelligent agents and integrating LLMs using Azure OpenAI, adding new layers of smart automation to my work.

Currently working at **Avanade**, where I turned my internship into a full-time role by consistently delivering value and embracing continuous learning. I'm also a **Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador** at the Gold level and actively involved in the tech community, mentoring students and sharing knowledge through talks and workshops.

I believe in writing code that’s not just functional, but also **meaningful and human-centered**. The best solutions come from combining solid engineering with empathy — and that’s the kind of work I strive to build.

Curious by nature. Always learning. Always building.
